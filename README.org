* Boot environ

** What is it?

Compatibility layer with the [[https://github.com/weavejester/environ][environ]] library by James Reeves. 

The *environ* library ships with a Leiningen plugin that will write an environment map specified in *project.clj* to disk. Typically, this file is git ignored and used during development time. This boot task will simply write to disk the environment map specified in a build pipeline or on the command line, allowing you to leverage environ in the same way as with Leiningen.

In production, you’ll likely environment variables set in the shell or java properties. Those are also supported by the *environ* library.
